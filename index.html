      NieR: Automata is a JRPG that was released in the year 2017 developed by
      Platinum Games, created by Yoko Taro and published by Square Enix. This
      game is a spinoff part of a long running series originally titled
      Drakengard and a sequel to NieR: Replicant. The story follows 2 androids
      named 9S and 2B and their fight against the Machines in order to protect
      the “Council of Humanity” during the 14th Machine War. As you progress
      through the game you realise that this game has multiple endings starting
      from A-Z with maybe a bonus one from a DLC, many of them are joke endings
      with only 5 leading to the ending of the storyline of 2B and 9S(endings A,
      B, C, D and E), throughout the playthroughs the perspective begins to
      change as it switches from first 2B to 9S and 9S to A2, eventually
      allowing the perspectives to switch more and more frequently leading to
      the games final climax. As you play through the first and second ending
      and its missions you see 2B and 9S discover machines trying to understand
      human concepts and imitating their behaviour like religions, wearing
      clothes and creating hierarchies. Through working with the resistance you
      come to meet Pascal and the group of machines that have separated
      themselves from the machine network and you begin working alongside them
      as the story unfolds and the true antagonists are presented. As well as
      the game, NieR: Automata recently got an anime adpatation that came out
      earlier this year, the anime is finished but during it's production
      several hiatus' ended up delaying the anime from finishing until after
      July.

      Mononoke is a 2007 anime series that originated from 2006s Japanese horror
      anthology named Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales featuring a 3 episode story
      arc called Bakeneko or Goblin Cat. The main character of this series is
      never named but it is called the Kusuriuri or Medicine Vendor with the
      various arcs of the story following him wandering, encountering and
      destroying Mononoke. Mononoke being a type of Ayakashi which are spirits
      that linger in the human world, binding themselves to the negative human
      emotions. The medicine vendor uses his knowledge and the testimonies of
      the people around him in order to determine the Mononoke's Shape(Kachi),
      Truth(Makoto) and Reason(Kotowari) which is used to unlock his sword to
      exorcise the spirit. The story arcs range from 2-3 episodes starting from
      the anthologies Bakeneko arc and ending with a newer arc with another
      Bakeneko. A very large and distinct part of the series would be its avant
      garde animation and general style, using an almost Ukiyo-e style the anime
      blends both 3D environments with 2D animation with a paper texture to
      create very vibrant scenes. Around the series 15th anniversary, a new
      addition to the series was announced with a teaser for a new movie.
      Initially it was set to come out in 2023 but due to some problems with the
      original Japanese VA, it got delayed to release in summer 2024.

      This genre of music originated in the 1980s as a fashion and music scene
      movement. The style is inspired by glam rock and other 80s rock music and
      defined by the visuals and performance using elaborate use of outfits,
      hair and an endogenous aesthetic. The genre started in Japan's underground
      music scene and throughout the years fought declines and ended up becoming
      largely popular after going through several transitions. Visual Kei
      doesn’t really follow any specific music genre and can range from punk
      rock, heavy metal and electronica and is instead identified by its visual
      components like costumes, make-up and hair. As of now my personal
      favourite groups are Gulu Gulu, Kaneto Juusei, Dadaroma, Amai Bouryoku and
      Kebyo. While I may not understand the lyrics fully due to lack of
      translations, the sounds and style of each group are very enjoyable in my
      opinion and each of them have a uniqueness to them.
